"""11.11 — Route inventory and exposure classification (media-service-m8).

Locks the media-service-m8 route surface so:
- Adding or removing a route requires an explicit update to
  ``media_service/route_inventory.json``.
- Every route in the inventory carries an exposure label
  (public / authenticated / admin / internal / health / metrics).
- Internal and health routes are absent from the OpenAPI schema.
- The ``/media/v1/internal`` prefix is excluded from the public Traefik
  router (enforced by the structural Traefik tests); the inventory records
  ``traefik_router=internal`` so the classification is machine-checkable.
- The ``/media/metrics`` endpoint (conditional on ``METRICS_ENABLED``) is
  excluded from the schema when registered.

The test reads the live app route table (not a subprocess) to avoid the
gap between static analysis and what FastAPI actually registers.
