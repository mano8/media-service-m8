"""Structural tests for the Docker publish workflow (plan item 11.5).

Asserts that `docker-publish.yaml` contains all required supply-chain
hardening steps — SBOM generation, keyless cosign signing, CVE-gated Trivy
scan, and release artifact upload — without actually running the workflow.

Rules asserted here:
- CRITICAL/HIGH Trivy scan is present and blocks push (exit-code "1").
- A non-blocking JSON Trivy scan is present for release artifact attachment.
- SBOM generation step uses anchore/sbom-action.
- A cosign signing step runs after push (skipped on workflow_dispatch).
- The publish job declares `id-token: write` (required for keyless OIDC).
- The publish job declares `contents: write` (required for release upload).
- The publish job declares `attestations: write` (required for provenance).
- SBOM and Trivy JSON are uploaded as release assets on the release event.
- The multi-arch build-push step has `provenance: mode=max`.
- cosign and SBOM steps are skipped / gated on `workflow_dispatch` correctly.
- cosign sign references the image digest from the push step output.

No Docker or network access required; everything is parsed from the YAML file.
